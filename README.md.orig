# EPND FAIRifier / FAIRnotator

## Introduction

This repository contains the FAIRifier/FAIRnotator developed for the [European Platform for Neurodegenerative Diseases (EPND)](https://epnd.org). The tool available in this repository aims to interpret the FAIR implementation profile (FIP) definition, its referenced implementation profile files (in this case CEDAR templates to describe cohort metadata; and SHACL files to describe the information elements requested in the cohort), and present the end-user a web-based user interface to make their data FAIR and available to use within the EPND platform.

## How to run this software?

<<<<<<< HEAD
1. Checkout the git repository: `git clone https://github.com/MaastrichtU-CDS/EPND-FAIRification.git`
2. Open the folder: `cd EPND-FAIRification`
3. Execute the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file using `docker-compose up -d`.
4. Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) and follow the steps

To use a sample FAIR implementation profile (FIP) use the URL: `https://www.jvsoest.eu/fip.ttl`
=======
Please execute the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file using `docker-compose up -d`. Populate the graphdb next:
    ```
    cd management_webpage/development_endpoint
    sh run.sh
    ```

## How to build this software?

The software is actually built when executing docker-compose (see above). To force a re-build, use `docker-compose up -d --build`.

## How to develop on the frond-end?

1. Stop the web-ui service container (`docker-compose stop webui && docker-compose rm webui`)
2. Go to the management_webpage folder, and execute run.sh after all python dependencies are installed
    ```
    cd management_webpage
    python -m venv ./venv
    source ./venv/Scripts/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    sh run.sh
    ```
