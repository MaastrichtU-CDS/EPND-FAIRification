# Local turtle loading test

This is a testing folder. This corresponds to the current setting in [../config.json](../config.json) where a turtle folder can be specified. **Only turtle files are parsed**, where the filename is used to determine the graph name.

This folder is also used to store a cedar template. The tail of a url on localhost (e.g. the substring `cedar.json` in `http://localhost:5000/cedar.json`) should match a filename in this folder to actually render the cedar template.
