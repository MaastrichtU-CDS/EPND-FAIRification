# EPND FAIRifier / FAIRnotator

## Introduction

This repository contains the FAIRifier/FAIRnotator developed for the [European Platform for Neurodegenerative Diseases (EPND)](https://epnd.org). The tool available in this repository aims to interpret the FAIR implementation profile (FIP) definition, its referenced implementation profile files (in this case CEDAR templates to describe cohort metadata; and SHACL files to describe the information elements requested in the cohort), and present the end-user a web-based user interface to make their data FAIR and available to use within the EPND platform.
